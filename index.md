# Existential risk that a.i. could potentially have and how they can affect our digital identities

## What is Existential Risk? 

- Existential risk can be described as a world altering event that can potentially lead to the destruction of civillisation and the human race. A good example of this could be an asteroid colliding with the planets surface and destroying it. This website aims to look at the existential risk potentially imposed by A.I. When looking to the future and the potential of a.i.  there are two ideas that come to mind. The first is that a.i. will be incorporated into businesses which will cause a change in society and have a profound affect on our digital identities. The second is that they will revolt against humanity and destroy us, this is usually what is portrayed by the media.

## So what is an A.I.?

- A.I. stands for Arteficial Intelligence, it is in theory the human brain digitised and used by machines to be as smart as humans however in reality A.I. can be less smart or as commonly depicted in the media, smarter than humans.  


## The usefullness that A.I. can pose to humanity

- A.I. has the potential to be a great asset for humanity, in the future a.i. could be used to help run businesses at the highest efficiency levels possible, this would have a profound affect on our digital identities. When looking at digital identities itâ€™s good to have a Visitor and Resident map present to have as a physical representation.

- If a.i. are being used to help run business in the future this would have a massive impact on the institutional/resident part of the v and r map because a.i. can run a business then a lot of work would become automated, this would mean that a large portion of the work force would become redundant. This would cause a massive change in society as a majority of the population no longer has to work, this would affect our digital identities making them more focused around the personal part of the vr map.  

## The Existential risk that A.I. can pose to humanity

- When media looks at a.i. they believe that they will gain self-consciousness and seek out to destroy us, an example is Skynet from the Terminator franchise. If a.i. were to gain self-consciousness and wanted to eliminate us for whatever reasons that maybe, then they would be a serious a threat, however, all issues with an A.I. would lie in its programming. When designing an A.I. for a task it is imperative that it is designed to be aligned with our interests otherwise it may take destructive measures which could impact humanity as it would likely lack empathy, this has been a major cause for concerns in recent years. A great example is the Lethal autonomous weapons system which uses an A.I. to select, target and eliminate human targets without human intervention, if there was an error in that A.I's code a number of things could go wrong, for example carryig out a mission with civillians in the line of fire. 
- Another example could be an A.I. is tasked with terraforming an area it, the activities the A.I. carries out could cause extreme damage to our ecosystem and when humanity attempts to stop it we would be percieved as a threat and it would develop countermeasures against us.
- These example demonstrate that concerns around A.I. should be competence not malevolence.
