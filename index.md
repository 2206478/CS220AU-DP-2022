## What is Existential Risk? 

- Existential risk can be described as a world altering event that can potentially lead to the destruction of civillisation and the human race. A good example of this could be an asteroid colliding with the planets surface and destroying it. This website aims to look at the existential risk potentially imposed by A.I. and what can be done to avoid this. This website will all so look at the affect A.I. can have on digital identities.

## So what is an A.I.?

- A.I. stands for Arteficial Intelligence, it is in theory many lines of code written by humans to be as smart as humans however in reality A.I. can be less smart or as depicted in the media, smarter than humans.
