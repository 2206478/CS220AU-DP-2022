## What is Existential Risk? 

- Existential risk can be described as a world altering event that can potentially lead to the destruction of civillisation and the human race. A good example of this could be an asteroid colliding with the planets surface and destroying it. This website aims to look at the existential risk potentially imposed by A.I. When looking to the future and the potential of a.i.  there are two ideas that come to mind. The first is that a.i. will be incorporated into businesses which will cause a change in society and have a profound affect on our digital identities. The second is that they will revolt against humanity and destroy us, this is usually what is portrayed by the media.

## So what is an A.I.?

- A.I. stands for Arteficial Intelligence, it is in theory the human brain digitised and used by machines to be as smart as humans however in reality A.I. can be less smart or as commonly depicted in the media, smarter than humans.

## The usefullness that A.I. can pose to humanity

- A.I. has the potential to be a great asset for humanity, in the future a.i. could be used to help run businesses at the highest efficiency levels possible, this would have a profound affect on our digital identities. When looking at digital identities itâ€™s good to have a Visitor and Resident map present to have as a physical representation.

- If a.i. are being used to help run business in the future this would have a massive impact on the institutional/resident part of the v and r map because a.i. can run a business then a lot of work would become automated, this would mean that a large portion of the work force would become redundant. This would cause a massive change in society as a majority of the population no longer has to work, this would affect our digital identities making them more focused around the personal part of the vr map.  

## The Existential risk that A.I. can pose to humanity

- When media looks at a.i. they believe that they will gain self-consciousness and seek out to destroy us, an example is Skynet from the Terminator franchise. If a.i. were to gain self-consciousness and wanted to eliminate us for whatever reasons that maybe, then they would be a serious a threat. Without proper failsafe built into them they could do a number of things from accessing nuclear codes and using our own nukes to destroy us to targeting our economy by ruining the currency of each nation which cause society to collapse.
